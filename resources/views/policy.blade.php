                            Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with Katawars in ways that
                            require Katawars to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and
                            type of information that Katawars gathers depends on the nature of the
                            interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at
                            <a class="text-link-policyterms" href="{{ route('home') }}">Katawars.dev</a>
                            to provide an email address, and other potential information to necessary for processing payments.
                            In each case, Katawars collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
                            appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Katawars.
                            Katawars also may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
                            websites. Katawars does not disclose personally-identifying information other

                            from engaging in certain website-related activities.

                            which we call kata. Each time you complete a kata, your solution with the
                            username that you specify may be shown within a list of other solutions for that
                            kata. Each time you publish a kata that you created, your kata will be displayed
                            within our public kata directory, with your username and profile link associated
